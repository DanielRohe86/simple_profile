## Instructions for submitting your project

### Before you start developing

1. Clone the repository
   * `git clone git@github.com:tryber/sd-023-b-project-lessons-learned.git`.
   * Go to the repository folder you just cloned:
     * `cd sd-023-b-project-lessons-learned`

2. Install dependencies and initialize the project
   * Install dependencies:
     * npm install

2. Create a branch from the `master` branch
   * Check that you are on the `master` branch
     * Example: `git branch`
   * If not, switch to the `master` branch
     * Example: `git checkout master`
   * Now, create a branch where you will store your project's commits
     * You must create a branch in the following format: `firstname-lastname-project-name`
     * Example: `git checkout -b maria-soares-lessons-learned`

3. Create the files you will need to develop in the root of the project:
   * Verify that you are at the root of the project
     * Example: `pwd` -> the return will be something like _/Users/maria/code/**sd-023-b-project-lessons-learned**_
   * Create index.html and style.css files
     * Example: `touch index.html style.css`

4. Add changes to Git _stage_ and `commit`
   * Check that the changes are not yet in _stage_
     * Example: `git status` (new files should appear listed in red)
   * Add the new file to Git _stage_
       * Example:
         * `git add .` (adding all changes - _that were in red_ - to the Git stage)
         * `git status` (files should appear listed in green)
   * Make the initial `commit`
       * Example:
         * `git commit -m 'starting the project. LET'S GO WITH EVERYTHING :rocket:'` (making the first commit)
         * `git status` (a message like _nothing to commit_ should appear)

5. Add your branch with the new `commit` to the remote repository
   * Using the previous example: `git push -u origin maria-soares-lessons-learned`

6. Create a new `Pull Request` _(PR)_
   * Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tryber/sd-023-b-project-lessons-learned/pulls) _Pull Requests_ page
   * Click on the green _"New pull request"_ button
   * Click on the _"Compare"_ checkbox and choose your branch **carefully**
   * Click the green _"Create pull request"_ button
   * Add a description for the _Pull Request_, a clear title that identifies it, and click the green _"Create pull request"_ button
   * **Don't worry about filling out anything else for now!**
   * Go back to the [repository's _Pull Requests_ page](https://github.com/tryber/sd-023-b-project-lessons-learned/pulls) and check that your _Pull Request_ is created

---

### During development

* Commit changes you make to the code regularly

* Remember to always after one (or a few) `commits` update the remote repository

* The commands you will use most frequently are:
   1. `git status` _(to check what is in red - out of stage - and what is in green - on stage)_
   2. `git add` _(to add files to the Git stage)_
   3. `git commit` _(to create a commit with the files that are in the Git stage)_
   5. `git push -u branch-name` _(to push the commit to the remote repository the first time you `push` a new branch)_
   4. `git push` _(to push the commit to the remote repository after the previous step)_

## How to develop

### Linter

To guarantee the quality of your code in order to make it more readable, easier to maintain and following good development practices, we use the `ESLint` linter in this project. To run the linter locally in your project, run the command below:

```bash
npm run lint:styles
```

‚ö† **IN THIS PROJECT STYLELINT WILL NOT BE EVALUATED. YOU CAN RUN THE TEST LOCALLY AND MAKE CORRECTIONS IF YOU WISH!** ‚ö†

After cloning the project, you must create the **index.html** and **style.css** files that will contain your HTML and CSS code, respectively. Note that your files **must** have these names for your project to be tested correctly by the automatic evaluator.

You are free to add other files if necessary. If you have any questions, contact the Instructor who accompanies you.

Remember that your page must contain adequate semantics and to do this, check if your page is approved by [CodeSniffer](https://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/).


### Automatic evaluator

* Your project requirements are automatically evaluated, using a screen resolution of `1366 x 768` (1366 pixels wide by 768 pixels high).

* ‚ö†Ô∏è It is recommended to develop your project using the same resolution, by installing [this plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en) from `Chrome` to make it easier the resolution setting. ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Pay attention to the size of the images you will use in this project. **Do not use images larger than _500Kb_.**

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Use a tool [like this](https://picresize.com/pt) to resize images. ‚ö†Ô∏è

* If the evaluation fails with an error message similar to `[409:0326/130838.878602:FATAL:memory.cc(22)] Out of memory. size=4194304`, the images you are using are probably too large. Try resizing them to a smaller size.

To check whether your evaluation was computed successfully, you can check the **evaluator execution details**.

* On your _Pull Request_ page, above the "merge button", search for _**"Evaluator job"**_ and click on the _**"Details"**_ link;

* On the page that will open, look for the line _**"Cypress evaluator step"**_ and click on it;

* Analyze the results from the message _**"(Run Starting)"**_;

* If you have questions, consult [this video](https://vimeo.com/420861252) or look for the instructors.

To run the automatic evaluator locally in your project, run one of the commands below:

```bash
npm test
```

***or***

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

After executing the command above, a browser window will open and then just click on the name of the test file you want to run (*project.spec.js*, or *bonus.spec.js*), or to run all tests click on *Run 2 integration specs*

You are free to add new behaviors to your project, whether in the form of improvements to proposed requirements or new functionalities, **as long as such additional behaviors do not conflict with the proposed requirements**.

* You can do more than asked, but never less.

* **Nothing beyond what is requested in the requirements will be evaluated**. _This is an opportunity for you to exercise your creativity and experiment with the knowledge you have acquired._

## Requirements

### Tips

To put your page on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), there is no need to remove the content that is already there, you can just add this new page. To do this, all content of this project must be placed in a folder `/projetos/lessons-learned`.

### List of requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è Read them carefully and follow exactly what is asked. In particular, **pay attention to the names of _ids_ that some elements of your project must have**. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Failure to comply with a requirement, in whole or in part, will impact your assessment.
